            Your contact lens prescription allows you to purchase
            <a href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lenses"
              >contact lenses</a
            >
            that match your requirements from opticians or online suppliers. You
            should always be given a prescription after a successful contact
            lens fitting. If you didn’t receive one, in the UK it’s your legal
            right to have a copy, so just reach out to your optician and ask.

          <h2>Do I need a prescription for contact lenses in the UK?</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to correcting your eyesight, the answer is ‘yes’, you
            do need a prescription for contact lenses in the UK like you do for
            eyeglasses, as well as regular visits to your optometrist to check
            up on your eye health. However, even though you technically don't
            need a prescription to buy
            <a

              >coloured contact lenses</a
            >
            , our optical advisor recommends that an eye test will help you to
            choose the most suitable ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ordering contact lenses from us is super-easy, as we don't need to

              >verify your physical prescription</a
            >
            . Having a valid prescription is obviously essential, but we trust
            you to take your eye health into your own hands. If you would like
            us to verify it, we're happy to do that too.

          <h2>How do I read my prescription?</h2>
          <p>
            You can find your prescription on the piece of paper given to you by
            your optician during a check-up, on the end/side of your contact
            lens box or on the blister packs that contain your contact lenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            A written prescription usually includes the following
            specifications: base curve, diameter, power (or sphere), and then
            additional figures for Cylinder and Axis if you have
            <a

              >astigmatism</a
            >, and Addition and Dominant figures for
            <a
              href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/eye-care-centre/what-is-presbyopia"
              >presbyopia</a
            >
            correction. The prescription for your left and right eye will be
            listed separately as they may vary.
          </p>
          <strong>Example prescription:</strong>
          <table>

          </table>
          <p>
            <strong>Name & expiry date:</strong>Your prescription should also
            contain the name of your contact lens brand (e.g. Acuvue Oasys) and
            an expiry date, which is usually a year from the date of your
            check-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is an example of the prescription listed on the side of the
            box for 1-Day Acuvue Moist for Astigmatism.

          <!-- THIS NEED TO BE RED -->
          <p>
            Please be aware that a contact lens prescription is different from a
            glasses prescription, so you cannot use one for the other.

            <h3>What does each prescription figure mean?</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Base Curve (BC)</strong>
              : The base curve determines what type of fit is required for the
              lens to meet the curve of your eye; this is usually written in
              millimeters or sometimes with the words: flat, median or steep.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Diameter (DIA)</strong>
              : The diameter of the contact lens is also written in millimeters
              and determines the width that best fits your eye.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Power/Sphere (PWR/SPH)</strong>
              : This figure shows whether you're long or short-sighted and how
              much correction your eyes require. If you have long-sightedness
              (<a
                href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/eye-care-centre/what-is-hyperopia"
                >hyperopia</a
              >) your figure will begin with a + (plus sign) and if you have
              short-sightedness (<a
                href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/eye-care-centre/what-is-myopia"
                >myopia</a
              >), it will begin with a - (minus sign).

          <h3>Prescription Figures for Astigmatism</h3>
          <p>
            The below figures are only displayed on contact lens prescriptions
            where there is a need for astigmatism correction, and you require
            <a
              href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lenses/toric-contact-lenses"
              >toric lenses</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cylinder (CYL)</strong>: The cylinder will always be a minus
            number that increases in measures of 0.25. Much like the
            power/sphere figure that is shown on all standard prescriptions, the
            cylinder for toric lenses denotes the extra visual requirements
            needed for astigmatism and how severe the astigmatism is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Axis (AX)</strong>: Astigmatism is caused by the irregular
            curvature of the eye; the axis is a figure which determines the
            angle of the correction needed in order to see clearly. The Axis is
            always a number between 0 and 180 degrees.

          <h3>Prescription Figures for Presbyopia</h3>
          <p>
            The below figures are only displayed on contact lens prescriptions
            where there is a need for presbyopia/multifocal correction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Addition (ADD)</strong>: If you suffer from presbyopia it
            affects your near vision, the Addition figure determines what level
            of correction you need to be able to see clearly at a close
            distance. This is a number between 0.50 and 3.00, some contact lens
            brands refer to this as a high, medium or low.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dominant</strong>:
            <a
              href="https://www.visiondirect.co.uk/contact-lenses/multifocal-contact-lenses"
              >Multifocal</a
            >
            or bifocal contact lens wearers will see that the correction is
            determined by a dominant and non- dominant eye. This is the dominant
            figure, and is usually marked with a "D" and "N" to express which
            eye is which.
